# Pendulum

:::Intro (Objective)
The objective of this lab is to gain an understanding of what uncertainty is and how it can influence the choices we make in our experiments. Additionally we will want to qualitatively determine what parameters affect the period of the pendulum.
:::

The objective of this lab is to determine which physical quantities influence the period of a pendulum. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement. By making many measurements of each feature while keeping the other two constant you will construct an argument as to which feature or features influence the period.

# Introduction

## Simple Pendulum Basics
:::Figure (pendulumDiagram|l)
![A diagram of the apparatus. There is a vertical dashed line that marks the lowest point of the pendulum, while the bob itself is displaced to one side. There is an arc from the vertical to the displaced bob and it is labelled theta sub zero, for the initial angle. There is a marker running the length of the string to the middle of the bob to indicate the length of the pendulum designated as L. Lastly there is an m located inside the bob to show it has mass.](imgs/Lab1/PendulumDiagram.png "A diagram of the setup indicating the length, L, the mass, m, and the initial angle, Î¸_0.

:::

The simple pendulum is called such because the most simplified model of pendulum that we have. It assumes that we are using a point mass, $m$, at the end of a string of length, $L$, that has negligible mass itself. Notice the simple pendulum does not attempt to exactly replicate what is happening in the real world. Instead it makes some assumptions and ignores some real life features.

This is a typical thing in physics. Often times the real world gets extremely complicated and it becomes easier to make assumptions and ignore things. However, we must be thoughtful about what we choose to assume and ignore. We want to choose things that will have little affect what we are trying to measure. Sometimes we do this well, and sometimes we are too loose with our assumptions. In the latter case we must then reevaluate our simplified model and add back things we may have thought we could ignore, or relax some of our assumptions.

The thing that we will be focusing on is the period, $T$. For the simple pendulum we have three parameters available to us. The mass of the bob, $m$, the length of the pendulum, $L$, and the initial angle, $\theta_0$. Each of these is depicted in [](Figure-pendulumDiagram) We will be adjusting these three parameters to see what affects they have on the period.  

## Apparatus

:::Figure (fullApparatus|m|R)
![Picture of the apparatus. Has a metal bar vertically clamped to a table. At the top of the bar clamped on is another bar that is orthogonal to the original. Clamped to the horizontal bar is a large wooden protractor. In front of the protractor is a string goes through a hole in the horizontal bar. In the middle of the vertical rod is a piece of plastic that is used to adjust the length of the string.](imgs/Lab1/FullApparatus.jpg "Fully constructed pendulum apparatus")
:::

In [](Figure-fullApparatus) you see a picture of the apparatus you will be using. When you come in it will be setup as shown. One the table, as seen in [](Figure-equipment).D will be a container that should have a stopwatch, a metric measuring tape, and 6 bobs of the same size but made of different materials. The materials are wood, aluminum, brass, copper, steel, and zinc. Everything can be seen more clearly in [](Figure-equipment).

:::Figure (equipment|l)

D is the piece of tupperware with each of the previous items arranged inside.](imgs/Lab1/Equipment1.png "A) Pendulum Bobs B) Stopwatch C) Measuring Tape D) Container with objects")
:::

You can use the stopwatch to measure the period. 

To test mass you can switch which bob is at the end of the pendulum by pushing the paperclip at the end of the string through the bob. You can use the balance to measure the mass

To read your initial angle a protractor is attached to the setup.

To adjust the length you will use piece of plastic attached to the vertical steel pole. To use it, just squeeze the handles together and slide it up and down the pole. The length of the pendulum can be adjust from about 20 cm to 160 cm. You can use the measuring tape to precisely measure the length. 

Watch the video below for instructions on how to use the apparatus.

## Pre-Lab

:::Prelab
**Before coming to lab** you will need to complete **and submit on Gauchospace** your responses to [](Exercise-logistics), [](Exercise-alignment), and [](Exercise-procedure). This will be checked off by your TA when you get to class. 
:::

:::Exercise (logistics)
Answer the following:
1. Which color group is your section?
2. Which classroom number is your group meeting in during the second **full week** of the quarter?
3.  Which classroom number is your group meeting in during the third **full week** of the quarter?
4.  Which classroom number is your group meeting in during the fourth **full week** of the quarter?
5. What is your TA's name?
:::

:::Exercise (alignment)
1. When reading the initial angle using the protractor, you must look straight on or you might have an error from parallax. Briefly explain what parallax is.
2. How will this effect your measurement of the initial angle? 
:::

:::Exercise (procedure)
Write a step by step procedure outlining how you will collect data that will determine which of the three parameters, mass, length, and initial angle, affect the period of the pendulum.

You will not be graded on whether you have "the right" procedure. We are simply looking for effort that you have thought about this and that you will be ready to start taking measurements when you get to class.

# Making a measurement

::::::Activity
You TA will walk your class through an exercise in which you measure the period of the pendulum in multiple ways and discuss the different methods. 

:::Exercise
Write down the two period values you recorded in the activity. Make sure to indicate which is which.
:::

:::Exercise
1. What statistic are you using to characterize the classes measurement of the period?
2. What statistic are you using to characterize the uncertainty in the classes measurement of the period? 
:::

:::Exercise
From looking at the class data, make a argument for which method is more precise for measuring the period. Why do you think one method is more precise than the other?

# Looking for signal

::::::Activity
Your TA will walk you all through a final activity of looking for a sign of response in the period to the different parameters above, $L$, $m$, and $\theta_0$.

:::Exercise
1. Which parameter are you measuring?
2. What are the values of the other two parameters you in your experiment?
3. What is the data you collected?
4. What is the data the other groups collected?
:::

:::Exercise
1. Do you think the period depends on the parameter you measured? Why or why not?
2. Do you think the period depends any other parameters? Why or why not?
