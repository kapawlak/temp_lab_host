## Welcome to UCSB Physics 4L

Physics 4L is our calculus based physics lab course. The topics in the course cover some of what you will learn in Physics 4 and some of what you've learned in previous physics courses.

The purpose of this course is to explore the complex concepts you will learn in Physics 4 from an experimental prospective.

## Laboratory Guidelines and Policies



### Physics Department Lab Report Policies.
1. Careful and neat documentation is an important part of carrying out and reporting lab work and it will affect the scores on lab reports.

### Physical Laboratory Guidelines
All students attending lower division Physics Laboratory courses are reminded to observe the following rules:
1. Smoking, Vaping and the use of non-medical nicotine is strictly prohibited in the lab.
2. Food and drink are not allowed in the lab.
3. Shoes must be worn when working in the lab. Avoid wearing loose fitting clothing.
4. No animals allowed in lab, except for service animals.
5. When lasers are in use, avoid looking into the light beam. The high intensity may cause permanent damage to your 
eye. Be extremely careful not to reflect the beam into anyone else’s eyes. 
6. Radioactive isotopes should be handled carefully and by the casing only.
7. If equipment is broken or circuit elements burned out, report the fact to the instructor immediately so that the apparatus can be properly repaired.
8. Do not remove equipment or furniture from the lab.
9. Do not alter or remove lab equipment
