:::::::::Activity (prem|Permanent Magnet)
1. Lay a blank piece of paper on the table.
2. Distribute the small compasses equally around the paper and note the direction each one points. The north pole of the compass is painted red. Most of them will align themselves with the earth's magnetic field.

::: Note (mag_hints|10)
- The compasses sometimes stick in one orientation because of static friction between the needle and the center pin. Lightly tapping the face of the compass fixes this.
- The compasses may orient themselves in a seemingly random fashion, there are metal fixtures below the table which cause this. Move your paper to a location where you do not observe any strong effects.

3. Place the provided permanent magnet in the middle of the paper. Trace the outline of the magnet. For each compass, draw a small arrow in the direction of its north pole.

4. To double the number of data points, redistribute the compasses about the paper. They should be equally distributed and should not be at any of the original locations. Again draw an arrow in the direction of the compass.

:::::::::Activity (air_core|Air Core Electromagnet)
1. Get a new sheet of paper. Place coil A in the center and again distribute the compasses about the page. Wire the coil to the switch and battery as shown in Figure

2. Watch the compasses as you depress the switch. The effect is dramatic. The compasses will align themselves with the new field generated by the coil.
3. With the switch still depressed, draw an arrow for each compass. It is <b>not</b> necessary to move them to different locations now.
4. DO NOT change the paper. Reverse the leads running to the coil. This will reverse the direction that the current flows.
5. Depress the current switch. With the compasses in the same position, this time draw dashed arrows indicating the direction of the field.

:::Exercise (reverse_current|2 Points)
What happens when you reverse the current?

::: Note (mag_hints|10)
Magnetic fields are vectors, meaning that every point in space has a direction associated with it. This direction is defined exactly as we've demonstrated above, it is the direction the north pole of a compass needle will point under the influence of the field.
