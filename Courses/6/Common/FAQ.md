## Q: How do I receive full credit on a table in my lab report?

While the contents of the table are important for your grade and are  decided by the context of the lab activity, you can do things to ensure that you *don't loose points to frivouslous display issues*. 

**In order for the table to convey the data scientifically, it must contain:**

1. Data organized in columns with descriptive headers that specify variable names and **units**.  If a table must span multiple pages, a header needs to be added for every page.
2. Correct number of significant figures for the data. 
3. All data in a column aligned at the decimal point.
4. If you have any calculations in your table, then you should show your work for **one row** of the table. 


In [](#Figure-table_ex) we show an example of an excellent table and a not-so-great table. Just by glancing at them, you can probably guess which table is which -- the bad table is visually confusing and difficult to read, independent of its poor technical qualities.

::: col
![Table 2](../Common/imgs/FAQ/BadTable.png "b) Table 2")
:::

:::::::::

In (a), the two variables that were measured are clearly described, the headers have units, the values have the proper number of sig figs, and their decimal points are aligned. In (b) the variables are not clearly described. Even if you could determine what the two columns represent, there is no way for you to know the units. Is it seconds and millimeters? Hours and nanometers? Years and feet?

Your goal with a table, is to communicate what you did as simply as possible to those reading your report. For this class, that means your TA, who will be grading your report. If you are clear in your thoughts and your tables, it is more likely that your TA will be able to understand any mistakes you make. This will allow them to provide better feedback, and maybe even take off fewer points. If your TA can't follow what you did, they are more likely to take off points.


## Q: How do I receive full credit on a plot in my lab report?

While the contents of the plot are important for your grade and are decided by the context of the lab activity, you can do things to ensure that you *don't loose points to frivouslous display issues*. 

**In order for the plot to convey the data scientifically, it must:**

1. Identify the independent and dependent variables, and make sure you put them on the correct axes. 
2. Determine the range of each variable. Your data should take up most of the area of your plot. There *should not* be any large blank areas.
3. Clearly label each axis with the variable name and unit of measurement.
4. Plot the data as a scatter plot. DO NOT "connect the dots."
5. Draw the line of best fit (usually linear) and include its equation.
6. Provide a descriptive title that communicates the scenario that you are plotting.
:::

When it comes to a title, **don't** provide a title like "Distance vs. Time." This is a bad title. This information can be determined from just looking at the axes. Your title should describe what is happening, *e.g.*, "Distance Traveled by Car on Vacation Trip."

[](#Figure-goodgraph), below, is an example of a good plot, which shows the relationship between the color (wavelength) of the light emitted by several different LEDs and the measured voltage at which they turn on.  The Inverse Wavelength is the independent variable and the Turn-on Voltage is the dependent variable.



:::Figure (goodgraph|xl)
![Example of a Good Graph](../Common/imgs/FAQ/GoodGraph.png)
Example of a Good Graph
:::

Notice that the data take up the entire plot; there are no large blank areas. Both of the axes are labeled and have units. The data points are not connected, and there is a line of best fit. There is also a title for the plot that lets us know what the experimenter was doing.

# How to use the Manual

In all of the lab manuals you will notice some common environments. Each environment will have different tasks that you need to do in order to get full credit.

## Activities
Activities are tasks with specific instructions â€” generally steps to complete an experiment. Expand the activity below by clicking on it to read more.
:::::: Activity (intro| Getting Familiar)
This is an Activity.  Inside of an Activity, you might be asked to do different subtasks. Each of these subtasks should be included in your report. **If they are not, you will lose points**is
Typical subtasks might include:
- Making a table.
- Making a plot.
- Taking a screenshot of something you did on your computer.
- Making a hand drawing, and including a picture of it. 

This is not an exhaustive list, but includes the most common subtasks you will need to do. 

---
As practice, for this Activity, create a list of the following three things:
1. Your name.
2. What major you want to graduate with.
3. The person who has won the largest share of the 2020 Nobel Prize in physics.
4. The time right now.

::::::

## Exercises

Exercises are something that you should respond directly to as part of your lab report. There may be many different parts to a Exercise and you should answer each part. Sometimes Exercises are inside of Activities and other times they simply exist in the maintext to check that you are following the discussion. 

You should answer Exercises with a **full sentence** to get full credit. Some examples of bad answers are:
- Yes.
- It's bigger.
- It looks like it.
- Linear.

These sorts of answers will receive little to no credit.


:::::: Exercise

Please complete the following for this Exercise:
1. Copy the list you made in [](#Activity-intro) into the document you will turn in.
2. Add the name of your TA as an entry to this list.
3. Add the time of your weekly lab section as an entry to this list.
4. How many entries are in your list now, total?

## Notes and Warnings
::: Note 
This is a note. Notes don't require you to put anything in your report. 

The main point of a note is just to highlight some critical information for you. Please make sure to read every note.
:::

Like Notes, Warnings don't require you to put anything in your report. 
Warnings differ from Notes because they highlight potentially dangerous details of the procedure.
::: Warning 
This is a Warning. Please make sure to read every Warning to prevent harm to yourself and others. Please click to dismiss once you have read the Warning.
:::

## Information Boxes

In this course, information boxes come in many shapes and sizes. Click the arrow below to expand the information box on expanding boxes.

:::Hider (|Expanding Boxes)
The first kind of information box is an expanding box, like this one. This box usually contains supplementary information, and you may want to minimize it while working on the lab. It can also contain a check-your-understanding type of Exercise.

:::

:::Definition (Definition Box)
**Definition Boxes**: these are boxes that are used to frame the important definitions of technical words or concepts in the course. 
:::

:::Intro (Introduction Boxes)
These will appear at the top of a lab to give you an idea of what the week will focus on.
:::

Click this number in brackets: [fn]This is an in-line footnote. Hovering over one of these reveals hidden text that provides interesting and useful information to supplement the main text, usually including a link to an information source[/fn]

Click this question mark ;;;And this is a pop-over that offers a Hint;;;

## Check Your Understanding

We periodically will place small "Check your Understanding" quizlets in the text. These are optional tests to let you practice the concepts and are **not graded**. They usually contain some kind of feedback to aid you on your learning journey

:::Quiz (intro|Yes --- Uh-oh, read the text above this box again!|No --- Great! Thanks for paying attention!)
Are these quiz boxes graded?

:::

## Conclusion
Each lab report will ask you to write a conclusion statement about the main point of the lab. This should be a 1-3-sentence statement highlighting the most important point(s) of the lab. It should not describe how you feel about the lab, or reexplain what you did. A good example would be:
``` 
In this lab we showed that falling objects in air do not fall with constant acceleration. The major factors affecting air resistance are mass and cross sectional area.
``` 

A bad example would be:

```
In this lab I dropped a ball and timed how long it took to hit the ground. This was really cool and showed that things have air resistance. I really liked how some balls fell faster than others. This demonstrated to me that air can really affect things.
```
