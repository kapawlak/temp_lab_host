:::Exercise (noforce|2 Points)
In space (no gravity), at $t=0\text{ s}$, a ball is shot towards a wall at a velocity of $7.5 \text{ m/s}$. The ball hits the wall and perfectly reflects after collision, maintaining the same *speed*. At $t= 4 \text{ s}$, the ball is measured to be $20 \text{ m}$ from the wall.

1. Did any forces act on the ball? Defend your answer, explicitly referencing the ball's initial and final velocities as needed.
2. How far was the ball from the wall initially? ;;;Hint: Try breaking the problem into two parts  — before the collision and after — and writing down the constant velocity equations;;;
3. Sketch a graph of the ball's distance from the wall over time. You can do this on a digital drawing program or on paper and take a picture to attach to your report.

Zak launches a ball straight up into the air, from the ground, at $5 \text{ m/s}$. Assume $a = g = -9.81 \text{ m/s}$
1. How long does it take for the ball to reach the ground again? ;;;Hint: When the ball reaches the ground again, y=0 ;;;
2. How long does it take for the ball to reach the highest point of its trajectory? ;;;Hint: When the ball reaches the top of its trajectory, what is its velocity? ;;;
3. What is the ball's maximum height? ;;;Hint: Can you  use the time to reach the maximum height from part (b) to find this?;;;

:::Exercise (tffromy|1 Point)
The final time, $t_f$, is the time that the ball has hit the ground after being dropped from rest at some height $y_0$. 
1. Using [](#Equation-positionwithforce), write out an equation that solves for $t_f$ for an object at rest at an initial height of $y_0$. You can assume that the experiment takes place on earth so that $a=g$. ;;;Hint: First, set t= tf. What is y(tf)?;;; ;;;Hint: Watch your signs before and after applying the squareroot!;;;
2. What is the $t_f$ for an object released from rest at $y_0 = 1.0 \text{ m}$? $y_0 = 5.0 \text{ m}$? $y_0 = 20.0 \text{ m}$? $y_0 = 50.0 \text{ m}$?, $y_0 = 0.0 \text{ m}$? You may use that $g=-9.81 \text{ m/s}$
3. Using the points above, make a sketch of the $t_f (y_0)$ graph.

:::Exercise (confounded|2 Points)
In the previous Part we discussed the ideal behavior of a ball under constant acceleration. Brainstorm three possible reasons;;; including, e.g. environmental, experimenter mistakes, equipment;;; why the time it takes for a ball to reach the ground after being dropped in our real-life experiment may not match the ideal theoretical predictions. For each possible reason, indicate whether the cause would result in a faster-than-ideal drop time or a slower-than-ideal drop time and why.

:::Exercise (tables|2 Points)
1. Fill in the raw measurements of $t_f$ into your raw data tables. Include a copy of your raw table and processed table here. Make sure that this data and all calculated columns have the correct number of significant figures and have labeled units as necessary. ;;;If you were one of the droppers, please ask the TA for their measurements to use as your own;;;
2. Once it is available, use the calculated average $t_f$'s to fill in the theoretical table, and include a copy of the final table in this exercise.

You do not need to include the plot, only answer the following questions.
1. Does the plot look linear? Why or why not?
2. What is the slope of the line of best fit, including units?
3. What is the physical meaning of the line of best fit?

:::Exercise (|3 Points)
1. How do the average velocities from different fall distances compare to one another? Elaborate on if you see a trend.
2. Make an educated guess as to what the average velocity of this object would be if you dropped it from a height of $500 \text{ m}$, and support your hypothesis with your *data*.

:::Exercise (FinalevalAR|1 Point)
Reflect on the trajectories of the dropped objects and their properties.
1. Which objects, according to your data, were most influenced by air resistance as discussed? Support your conclusion with a sentence or two.
2. Does it make sense to you that these mentioned objects were affected most by air resistance? What physical properties to they have that might lead to high air resistance?

**Challenge Question**
######
We now want to discuss the impact of factors other than air resistance on our experiment. 
1. Do you think that the uncertainty introduced by you and your classmates' reaction times is significant in this experiment? Please answer this quantitatively, referencing your measured reaction time from this [Exercise](index.html?linkfile=lab0#Activity-randomerr) in Lab 0 and comparing it to the *variance* in measured times
2. You all had to start a stopwatch on a certain agreed upon signal, and then stop it the instant an object hit the ground. Do you think that the *systematic error* associated with the average *delay* in reaction time resulted in a **bias** in the measured $t_f$ being longer? ;;;This is a high level discussion, try your best here;;; 
3. Do you think that there any environmental factors that could have significantly altered the results of the experiment? ;;;Hint: consider things such as wind, weather, accidentally imparting a v0;;;. Argue your answer in a sentence or two. Pointing to evidence in the data is strongly encouraged for full credit.
