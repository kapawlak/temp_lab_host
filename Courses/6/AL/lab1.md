# Position, Velocity, Acceleration, and Falling Objects


:::Intro (This Week's Topic: Motion!|Objects for Dropping --- Feather, Basket Ball, Dog Ball|Stopwatch| Large Measuring Tape | Graph Paper)
This week we will review how to describe, mathematically, the trajectory of a body moving under the influence of a force. For your Pre-Lab, you will sharpen your calculational abilities on some test problems, and make some educated guesses about the influence of **air resistance**.

Following this discussion we will turn our attention to a real experiment. You will analyze the data from this "real-world" experiment, compare the results to the predictions of the "ideal" theory, and then draw inferences about the underlying physics.

# Keeping Track of Motion in 1D

For a body in motion, we are typically concerned with three variables which characterize the trajectory of some object. The first and most familiar is the **position**, which tells you where an object is at some instant, with reference to some coordinate system. The position of an object, however, is not always useful — think about a fast moving car on the highway: while you may know which exit you saw it at in one instant, you won't know where the car is a few minutes later unless you know its **velocity**. The velocity of a car, as you instinctively know, tells you something about how its position *changes in time*. 

Now, if that car happens to be on Route 405 in Los Angeles, even knowing its velocity won't help you figure out where it is minutes later — the heavy LA traffic means that the car's velocity could change at a moment's notice! This change in velocity over time is called **acceleration**. 




:::Definition (Variables of Motion in 1D)

The **position**, $x(t)$, quantifies where a body is located in space at a given time. In this lab, this is simply the *height* of an object above the ground.

--- 

The  **velocity**, $v(t)$, quantifies how the *position* of an object changes over time. It is a measure of the speed *and* direction the object is traveling at a given time.

--- 

The **acceleration**, $a(t)$, quantifies how the *velocity* of an object changes over time. Physically, it originates from the forces acting on the body through $F=ma$.


:::


These three variables are interrelated, as each of the latter two quantities tells you about the *change over time* of the previous one [fn]You may wonder what a change in acceleration is. This is called [*jerk*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)).We could go on to define the change in jerk and so on, but as it turns out, the three variables in our current discussion are often more than adequate to describe most kinds of motion[/fn]. In this lab, we will learn about what these relationships mean in both a qualitative and quantitative way. Since we are going to experiment with these concepts by dropping a ball off the side of Broida, the remaining discussions in the manual will focus on this scenerio.

:::Note (vectors|3 )
Unlike the simple case of 1D motion, when we are considering motion in 2D (a plane) or 3D (a volume), all three quantities must be expressed as *vectors*, with independent components for each possible direction of motion. 
:::


## Motion with No Forces

To make our discussion concrete, we should review some basic physics for the case in which there are no forces acting on the body of interest. In this and the following sections, we will do thought experiments on what happens to a ball as it is released in various scenarios, similar to the experiment you will perform. 

### An Object at Rest

The first case of force-free motion to consider is a body starting at **rest**.
:::Definition (Rest|6 C)
An object at **rest** has a velocity of $v=0 \text{ m/s}$ in the frame of interest. 
:::

From [](#Definition-VariablesofMotionin1D), [](#Definition-Rest), and your intuition alone, you can probably guess what happens to an object at rest when no force is acting upon it. Take a minute to consider the situation and try answering the *Check Your Understanding* box below ;;;Don't worry — This isn't graded!;;;.


:::Quiz (rest| $0\text{m}$ --- No! Would mean that the speed was $-2.5\text{m/s}$|$25 \text{m}$ --- Correct! Since the ball is stationary  $$v_0= 0\, \text{ m/s}$$ so it is still at $y=25\text{ m}$!| $250\text{ m}$ --- No way! Go back and check your work.)
 Let's imagine that that at $t=0$, we have a ball at **rest** at a height $y_0= 25 \text{m}$. There are no forces acting on the ball. What is its position at $t=10\text{s}$?
:::
:::Figure (noforce|m|R)
![A graph showing the trajectory a ball takes in time when no force is applied to it. The vertical axis of the graph is distance and the horizontal axis is time. The plot appears as a perfectly horizonal line through the initial position of the ball since the position does not change.](imgs/VelAcc/nov_pos.gif "The trajectory of the ball with no force and zero initial velocity")
:::
Indeed, when there are no forces acting on a body, there is no acceleration; hence, the body's velocity does not change. Since the ball started at rest, e.g. $v(0\text{s})= 0\text{ m/s}$, it *stayed* at rest[fn] You might recognize this as Newton's 1st Law — the law of inertia![/fn]. Since the ball remains at rest, it's position doesn't change.




### An Object with Non-Zero Velocity
Now we imagine that this ball is given an initial velocity $v_0 = + 10$ m/s by being tossed upwards, with no forces acting upon it after its release (for example, in space).  Since no forces are acting on the ball, the *change* in the velocity must be zero, so $v(t) = v_0=10 \text{ m/s}$ for all time.  Note that the time, $t$, does not appear in this equation!

Since the velocity tells you how an object's *position* is changing with time, and we know that the velocity in the absence of force is constant, we can say that the position of the ball will increase by $10$ meters per second that passes. 


:::Quiz (const_vel| $125 \text{ m}$ --- Correct! The ball traveled for $10\text{ s}$ at $10\text{ m/s}$, meaning it travelled $10\text{ s} \times 10 \frac{\text m}{\text s} = 100$m from its initial position of $25$m|$25 \text{ m}$ --- Careful! This is where the ball would be if it was at rest.| $250 \text{ m}$  --- Don't multiply random numbers together — make sure your math makes physical sense.)

From the discussion above, we deduce that a ball that started at $x_0 = 25 \text{ m}$ with an initial velocity of $v_0 = 10\text{ m/s}$ at $t= 10\text{ s}$ will be located at $y(10 \text{s})$ =

:::
::::::
:::::::::

Generally, in the absence of external forces, we can capture this relationship mathematically as:

:::Equation (noforcep|Position at Constant Velocity)
$$
y(t) = v_0 t + y_0
$$

:::
In plain English, the above mathematical sentence translates to: "The position of the ball at a given time is equal to the distance it travels per unit of time (*e.g.*, seconds), multiplied by the time that has passed, plus its original position." Really make sure you understand this statement before moving on.

:::Exercise (noforce)
In space (no gravity), a ball is shot towards a wall at a velocity of $7.5 \text{ m/s}$. The ball hits the wall and perfectly reflects after collision, maintaining the same *speed*. At $t= 4 \text{ s}$, the ball is measured to be $20 \text{ m}$ from the wall.

1. Did any forces act on the ball? Defend your answer, explicitly referencing the ball's initial and final velocities as needed.
2. How far was the ball from the wall initially? ;;;Hint: Try breaking the problem into two parts  — before the collision and after — and writing down the constant velocity equations;;;
3. Sketch a graph of the ball's distance from the wall over time.
:::




## Motion Under Constant Acceleration
Once we include external forces acting on a body, we now must think about how the velocity changes over time. Consider that we repeat this experiment on the moon, so that our ball is accelerating toward the ground at approximately $a = -1.6$ m/s$^2$. 

Before we can think about how the *position* of the ball changes over time, we first have to analyze the *velocity*. Similar to [](#Equation-noforcep) for change in position, our equation for velocity is now:

:::Equation (constant-force| Velocity under Constant Acceleration)
$$
v(t) = a t + v_0 
$$
:::

:::Quiz (const-force| $ 6\text{ m/s}$ --- Careful about your signs! A positive velocity means that the ball is traveling *away* from the ground.| $ 16\text{ m/s}$ --- Careful about your signs! Is the acceleration in the same direction as the initial velocity?|$ -6\text{ m/s}$ --- Correct! By multiplying the change of velocity per unit time by the elapsed time, we can get the change in velocity)
Using [](#Equation-constant-force), we find that at $t = 10 \text{ s}$ our ball that had an initial velocity of $v_0 = 10 \text{ m/s}$ has a final velocity of: 
:::


While the [](#Equation-constant-force) easily lets us calculate the velocity at any time during constant acceleration, the changing velocity becomes an issue when we try to calculate the new position of our ball. Since now the velocity is continually changing, [](#Equation-noforcep) is no longer correct. We can see from Graph (a) in [](#Figure-withforce) that the expression for position as a function of time is no longer a simple linear relationship!

:::::::::Figure (withforce|xl|Row)

![](imgs/VelAcc/acc_pos.gif "(a) Position vs. time in the presence of an external force")
:::

![](imgs/VelAcc/acc_vel.png "(b) Velocity vs. time in the presence of an external force")
:::
::::::

 
:::::::::


### Position during constant acceleration

You might guess the equation for position is some kind of quadratic function after seeing [](#Figure-withforce). This is correct — given the relationship between velocity and acceleration above, it is an exercise in calculus to show that the following relationship is true:

:::Equation (positionwithforce| Position under Constant Acceleration)
$$
y(t) = \frac{1}{2} at^2 + v_0 t 
+y_0
$$
:::



:::Quiz (const-force2| $ 45\text{ m}$ --- Great Job.)
Putting it all together, for the ball on the moon, we have that $x(10\text{ s}) = $ 
:::


## Motion of Falling Objects

In the last example, we considered the motion of an object under constant acceleration due to gravity. In this lab, we will test the validity of this model under earth's gravity. 

When dropped from the same height, which one of these objects &ndash; stone or feather &ndash; will hit the ground first? Most people will say, "That depends." If this is done in a normal room, the stone wins, as your intuition may tell you. If, however, it is done in a *vacuum*, which contains no air, both hit the bottom at the same time! The question we would like to answer is: "How does the presence of the air change the equations of motion for falling objects?"

In the next activity, you will watch videos of someone dropping a variety of balls from a sixth-floor walkway. For one drop, you will measure and record height and time data, and for the rest, you will be given the data. You will plot these data, and use your results to test the validity of one of the motion formulas, namely,

:::Equation
$$
y(t) = y_0 + v_{0}t + \frac{1}{2} at^2
$$
:::

where y is the position, $v_{0y}$ the initial velocity, $a_{y}$ the acceleration, and t the time. In some of these examples, you may find that the data do not match the theoretical equation. It is your job to determine how and why these equations change, by using your sharp analytical skills.


## General Properties of Motion Curves
:::Figure (graphs|m|R) 

![(a) Constant Position vs. Time](imgs/VelAcc/Constant.png "(a) Constant Position vs. Time")

![(b) Linear Position vs. Time](imgs/VelAcc/Linear.png "(b) Linear Position vs. Time")

![(c) Quadratic Position vs. Time](imgs/VelAcc/Quad.png "(c) Quadratic Position vs. Time")

:::

Before you start the lab, we have one last theoretical discussion: given a plot of position versus time, how can we make quantitative and qualitative statements about the physics of a falling object? 

To answer this, we have two important statements to make from the discussion above:

1. The velocity of an object at a certain time is the slope of the distance-time graph at that point.
2. Similarly, the acceleration of an object at a certain point is the slope of the velocity-time graph at that point.

Before we discuss this, there are three plot shapes that are important to understand for this analysis: constant, linear, and curved. 



Constant refers to a value that is not changing with time; the plot is a horizontal line as shown in  [](#Figure-graphs)<u>a</u>. Linear refers to a value that is changing with time, whose plot has a constant slope as shown in [](#Figure-graphs)<u>b</u>. Curved refers to a value that is changing with time, and for which the slope of the plot is changing with time, as shown in [](#Figure-graphs)<u>c</u>.

[](#Figure-motiongraphs), obtained from from Hyperphysics, shows the trajectory of a body whose acceleration is constant for each segment of time. Acceleration being constant for each segment is important for simplifying our plots.
:::row
:::
[](#Figure-motiongraphs)<u>a</u> shows the three plots unobstructed. For each section of the plots, notice how the velocity plot and the position plot correspond to each other. Also notice how each of these plots and the acceleration plot correspond to each other.

:::col l6
![](imgs/VelAcc/HP_MotionGraphs_Annotated.png)
:::
::::::
:::::::::


 In particular notice that:
 - Whenever the position plot is linear, the velocity is constant. 
 - Whenever the position plot is curved, the change in velocity is linear (the acceleration is constant). 
 - If the position is curving upwards, the velocity is positive.
 - If the position is curving downwards, the velocity is negative. 
 - The acceleration plot corresponds to the velocity plot in exactly the same way that the velocity plot corresponds to the position plot.



 [](#Figure-motiongraphs)<u>b</u> shows the same graphs as in panel a, with descriptions for selected points on the top two graphs, of the information that one can infer from the graphs as those points. Please study the plots, and the notes in panel b, to understand how the plots are related to each other.

:::::: Exercise (analysis)
Now that you have gained familiarity with position, velocity and acceleration plots, you can do analysis. In this exercise you will take a new position plot and create sketches of the velocity and acceleration plots. Please see Figure 6 below.


:::Figure (pvtsketch|l)
![](imgs/VelAcc/PvTSketch.png)
:::

The dashed lines indicate where the plot changes from one of the plot shapes mentioned above, to another. 

1. Make a sketch plot for velocity with dotted lines in the same positions. ;;;A sketch is just a quick drawing to display the important features of a plot, e.g., linear, parabolic or constant. You should label the axes, but you don't need a title.;;;

2. Sketch the velocity curve for each segment in your skeleton plot.

3. Do the same to make an acceleration plot. Please note that you will now have to refer to the velocity plot instead of the position one.

4. Describe the motion in words. What is happening to the object in each segment of time? 

:::Note
Make sure to take a picture of your sketch plots and include them in your report along with the description.

# The Experiment

## Collecting Data from an Experiment
:::Materials (Objects for Dropping --- Feather, Basket Ball, Dog Ball|Stopwatch| Large Measuring Tape | Graph Paper)
:::



In [](#Activity-ball-drop) we will look at different balls being dropped from the walkways of Broida Hall.

How do the properties of these sport balls affect how they fall?


::::::Activity (ball-drop|Making the measurement)
**Instructions:**
1. Round up the objects for the test drop and head out to the designated dropping area with your TA. 
2. Using the measuring tape, determine the height from the drop zone to each of the floors. The railing makes for a good 
reference point from where you or one of your group members will drop things.

:::Exercise (collect-heights)
1. What is the distance $y_1$ from the drop zone to the rail on the second floor?
2. What is the distance $y_2$ from the drop zone to the rail on the third floor?
3. What is the distance $y_3$ from the drop zone to the rail on the fourth floor?
:::

3. Before you drop anything, be sure the drop zone is clear of people! From the second, third, and fourth floors of 
Broida, have one team member release an object from the recorded height and let it fall to the ground while the other 
team members time the fall. Be sure you release the object cleanly without imparting an initial upward or downward 
speed. Then $v_y(0)$ = 0 and $a_y= -9.8 \text{m}/\text{s}^2$
.
4. Record the times measured by each member. The average is the drop time for the object. These data should be copied 
by each member of the team as each will turn in a lab report.
Warning: Do not throw the objects to the upper floors. Use the stairs. 
5. Repeat this procedure for several objects.
6. For each object, make a table on your data sheet with the height and fall time. Take note of the units!
7. For each object, graph the height $y$, vs. fall time $t$. Label your graph with the proper units. Your graph should have 
four points (including the origin). This is enough data to check basic trends. Use a separate sheet of graph paper for 
each object.

:::Exercise
1. Include the graphs made in this Activity, being sure that they are properly labelled and have all the qualities of a [Good Figure](google.com). 
2. Are any of these plots linear?
3. In terms of displacement, velocity, or acceleration, what does it mean if the plot is linear? 
:::

8. On each of these same graphs, also plot $y = \frac{1}{2}a_y t^2$ ;;; using $a_y = -9.8 \text{ m}/\text{s}^2= -32 \text{ ft}/\text{s}^2$, and your fall times to get $y$ ;;; and compare this to your original data. Remember to include a few sentences of analysis with each graph.

::::::Activity drop

In this exercise you will be collecting data for the height of a ball in free fall versus time. All four balls will be dropped, but you will **be taking data only for the basketball.** The data for the other balls have been taken for you.

We have annotated [](#Video-balldrop) for you with the height measurements and an embedded stopwatch. These will be useful tools for your data collection.

**Instructions:**

1. Watch [](#Video-balldrop) and see how each ball falls to the ground. 

2. Take 10 data points by making the video pause, and recording the distance from the top, and the timestamp on the embedded stopwatch. 

3. Place your recorded data points in a table with the headers "Time (s)" and "Y_Basket (m)."

## Understanding & Organizing Data
You have now collected some data for a basketball falling from the sixth floor of Broida! As mentioned above, three other balls were dropped from the same point at Broida. Rather than have you repeat the same data collection, we have collected data for you by using a piece of software called Tracker.

Tracker allows us to monitor the location of the ball at every frame of the video, which happens once every 1/30 second. This method has two advantages:

1. We are able to identify the location of the ball more precisely than we could, say, by eye.
2. We are able to collect many more data points than we could if we did so by hand.

Below is a short video demonstrating how we used the Tracker software to collect data for the four drops.

# Analyzing the Data

## Qualitatively Understanding your Data
In [](#Activity-anal) you will begin analyzing the drop data. You will apply what you learned in the Introduction to real data, and try to **infer** something about the underlying physics.

:::Activity anal
**Instructions:**

1. Start by just looking at your data. 
    - **Analyze them qualitatively by using the tools you learned in Part 1 of the lab.** 
    - Try to determine for which parts of each drop the balls are falling under constant acceleration or constant velocity.
2. Notice that the data sets for the dog ball, basketball and volleyball all look very similar. The beach ball data are quite different from the other three data sets. Pick one of the three similar data sets and the one for the beach ball, and **sketch**[fn] A sketch is just a quick drawing to display the important features of a plot, *e.g.*, linear, parabolic, or constant. You should label the axes and the two lines, but you don't need a title. You shouldn't spend more than five minutes drawing this.[/fn] a velocity vs. time plot for both data sets on the same graph.
3. Examine the velocity lines, and interpret them to translate the plot into a brief description (one or two sentences) of the drop for both balls.
4. Take a picture of your sketch and include it in your lab report, being sure to include your description.

:::

## Quantitatively Understanding your Data
In [](#Activity-fit), for each of the datasets, you will perform a polynomial fit of degree 2. This will draw a line of best fit by using a quadratic function. That is, it will attempt to fit the equation:


:::Equation fit
$$
y = ax^2+bx+c
$$
:::

The computer will adjust $a$, $b$, and $c$ to best fit the data provided. Let's start by understanding what $a$, $b$, and $c$ are.

[](#Equation-fit) looks a lot like our equation for motion (kinematic equation). Let's relate [](#Equation-fit) to the kinematic equation. We do this in the table below. Each row starts by defining the variable. The next column has the symbol we use to represent the variable in the fit. The final column has the equivalent symbol used in the kinematic equation.
:::Table (eq)
| Variable Name | Fit Symbol | Kinematic Symbol |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Time     | $x$     | $t$     |
| Position | $y$    | $y$    |
| Acceleration| $a$ | $\frac{1}{2}g$ |
| Initial Velocity | b |  $v_0$ |
| Initial Position | c | $y_0$
:::



::::::Activity (fit)
**Check your understanding:** 

It is critical that you understand a few concepts before moving forward. Below are three questions. Read them and spend a few minutes trying to answer them for yourself. When you think you have the answers, click the link at the bottom to reveal the answers. 

1. For an ideal fall (one that the kinematic equation describes exactly), what should the value of $a$ in your fit be?
2.  For a drop like the ones in the video, where the ball is released from rest, what should the value of $b$ in your fit be?
3. When the origin is defined as the release point of the ball, as it is in the video, what should the value of $c$ in your fit be?

:::Hider Answers
1. The value of $a$ in your fit should be $\frac{g}{2}$, which is approximately $4.9$ m&middot;s$^{-2}$
2. The value of $b$ in your fit should be $0$ m&middot;s$^{-1}$, because the ball is being released from rest. It has no initial velocity.
3. The value of $c$ in your fit should also be $0$ m. This is because $c$ is the initial position of the ball, and we defined the origin to be the point where the ball is released.

Keep in mind, these answers are for an ideal (not real world) drop. When we drop a ball in the real world, there will be factors and errors that shift the value of $a$, $b$, and $c$ from the ideal values. 
:::

After answering these questions, return to your spreadsheet and play with the curve fitting tools in Google Sheets. If you need a reminder for how to do curve fitting, please refer to the video from the last lab:

## Quantitatively Understanding your Data 2
In [Ex](#Ex-quant) we will be more quantitative about our analysis. We will perform specific fits to our data and use the results to analyze the underlying physics in our experiment. 

::::::Activity quant
**Instructions:**

1. For each of the drops, perform a polynomial fit of degree 2. 
2. Create a table to summarize the information from your fits. **Hint:** $a=\frac{g}{2}$, so make sure to solve this for $g$ before putting it in your table. Your table should look like the following:

:::Table


| Parameters| Ideal Drop | Dog Ball | Basketball | Volleyball | Beach Ball|
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -- | -- | -- |
| Gravitational Accel. [*g*] (m/s$^2$)     |      |      |   |   | |
| Initial Velocity  (m/s)   |      |      |   |   | |
| Initial Position    (m) |      |      |   |   | |

:::

3. Calculate the percent discrepancy of the acceleration from ideal for each of the four drops. You can do this in a spreadsheet if you'd like, but please show your work for **one** of the calculations. 

:::Exercise 
1. What is the cause of this systematic error in the measurement of $g$?

2. Based on the picture of the balls, and what you know about the balls generally, why do you think the systematic error is different for the different balls? 
:::

4. Now let's look more closely at the initial velocity and intital position for the different drops. Do you notice that as the drops get farther from ideal, the initial velocity and the inital position get farther from ideal as well?

:::Exercise
1. What is the percent difference in initial velocity of the beach ball and the basketball?

2. What is the percent difference in initial position of the beach ball and the basketball?
:::

The smaller error (percent discrepancy) in the value of $g$ for the basketball indicates that it has less systematic error, or that it is a better representation of our model (objects falling under constant acceleration). The large percent difference the beach ball has in the initial velocity and initial position relative to those for the basketball, combined with the larger percent discrepancy in the value of $g$ for the beach ball, hints that the beach ball strongly doesn't follow the constant acceleration model.

::: Question
If the beach ball isn't falling under constant acceleration, what model might it be falling under?
:::

5. Create one more plot of only the beach ball falling, but use only one second of data near the end, where the plot looks most linear.
6. Perform a linear fit on these data.
