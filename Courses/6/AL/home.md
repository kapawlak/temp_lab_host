## Laboratory Guidelines and Policies



### Physics Department Lab Report Policies
1. To receive a passing grade, all labs must be completed.
2. One day is reserved to allow an opportunity to make up missed labs. To be eligible to take a make-up lab, the student 
must provide a written verifiable medical, athletic, or religious excuse that may be used for only ONE experiment per 
quarter. This excuse must be presented by the student to their TA prior to make-up week.
3. Careful and neat documentation is an important part of carrying out and reporting lab work and it will affect the 
scores on lab reports.

### Physical Laboratory Guidelines
All students attending lower division Physics Laboratory courses are reminded to observe the following rules:
1. Smoking, Vaping and the use of non-medical nicotine is strictly prohibited in the lab.
2. Food and drink are not allowed in the lab.
3. Shoes must be worn when working in the lab. Avoid wearing loose fitting clothing.
4. No animals allowed in lab, except for service animals.
5. When lasers are in use, avoid looking into the light beam. The high intensity may cause permanent damage to your 
eye. Be extremely careful not to reflect the beam into anyone elseâ€™s eyes. 
6. Radioactive isotopes should be handled carefully and by the casing only.
7. If equipment is broken or circuit elements burned out, report the fact to the instructor immediately so that the 
apparatus can be properly repaired.
8. Do not remove equipment or furniture from the lab.
9. Do not alter or remove lab equipment
