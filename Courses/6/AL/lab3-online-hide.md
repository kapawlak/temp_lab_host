:::Intro (This Week...|Air Track|Glider|Range Finder --- with calculator|Riser Block)
This week we will look at the quantity that we call energy and its transformations. In classical physics, there are two categories of energy:
 1. **Kinetic Energy** &mdash; what you may know as *energy of motion*, or the energy stored in the inertial motion of an object. An object has *kinetic energy* if you have to perform **work** on it to bring it to rest.
 2. **Potential Energy** &mdash; which is stored energy an object has due to certain kinds of **work** having been exerted on it, *e.g.*, the energy a barbell has after you have lifted it from the floor to above your head.

In addition to understanding energy, this week we will investigate **work** and its relationship with **force** in converting energy from one form to another.

# Energy Transformation



In this lab you will be investigating the transformation of energy from one form to another, namely the transformation between potential energy (PE) and kinetic energy (KE). Potential energy is stored energy. Two examples are the energy in a compressed spring and the gravitational potential energy that an object has by virtue of its height above the ground. 

:::Definition (Potential Energy)
**Potential Energy** is the energy possessed by a body by virtue of its position relative to others, stresses within itself, electric charge, and other factors.

Kinetic energy is the energy stored in motion. A mass, having been flung upward, has kinetic energy. When an object is dropped from some height above the ground, gravity accelerates it downward, converting its initial potential energy into kinetic energy as it falls, a scenario you can investigate yourself in [](#Simulation-transform). 

:::Definition (Kinetic Energy)
**Kinetic Energy** is the energy a body possesses by virtue of being in motion. In order to bring a moving body to rest, you would need to perform an amount of work equivalent to its kinetic energy. 
:::

In the example of the object being dropped from rest, the mass starts out with zero kinetic energy. The force of gravity does work on the mass, thus giving it kinetic energy. This would suggest that work and energy are equivalent. Indeed, the Work-Energy Theorem states that the work done on an object is always equal to the change in kinetic energy of the object. Work and energy have the same units (kg ⋅ m$^2$ ⋅ s$^{-2}$), which constitute the standard unit of energy called the Joule (J). We will not discuss work in detail, but should note that it is defined as the product of the force acting on an object and the distance over which it acts, hence the aforementioned units.


For another example, loading a stone into a slingshot requires you to do work in stretching the elastic band by pulling the stone back against it. When you have pulled the stone all the way back, the work you have done is now stored as potential energy in the band. When you release the stone (a mass), the band relaxes, accelerating the stone from rest to whatever speed it has attained just as it flies free of the elastic band. Whatever potential energy was stored in the band, which you provided by stretching it, is now kinetic energy of the stone flying through the air.

:::Exercise (slingshot|2 Point)
Where did the kinetic energy come from?
:::
Our main focus will be a fundamental law of nature called the Law of Conservation of Energy. This law states that, in the absence of dissipative forces such as friction,

:::Equation
$$
\text{ PE}+\text{ KE}=\text{ Total energy}
$$
:::

Simply put, this means that the total energy in a closed system remains *constant* even when the individual KE and PE are changing &mdash; they must always add up to the same total energy unless the system is open.


## Return of the Glider

As with last week's experiment, we are interested in looking at a delicate relationship between two variables, which can be confounded by external forces, such as friction. In order to avoid these as much as possible, we will make sure of the glider experiment once again. 

Just like the previous experiment, we will observe the motion of a glider sliding on an inclined air track under the influence of gravity. This time, however, we will be concerned with the glider's *energy*. We will collect data that will allow us to calculate, indirectly, the glider's kinetic and potential energy by using readily measurable quantities.  

[](#Figure-hov3) below shows the setup we will use for this part of the lab.  We will measure the position and velocity of the glider by means of a range finder (an ultrasonic motion sensor).  We will denote the position of the glider along the track $x$, and the velocity $v$. 

:::Figure (hov3|xl)
![](imgs/EnergyTransformation/diagram.png "Setup for the energy-transformation portion of the lab")

:::

Note that the position and velocity change with time as the glider moves along the track. We will set the x-axis to be along the track (with the positive direction up the track), and our origin $x=0$ at the bottom of the track.


From the position and velocity measurements, we can perform a calculation to indirectly determine the kinetic and potential energies. The formulae needed for this calculation are provided in the [Appendix](#part5).

:::Exercise (math|3 Point)
The glider is at rest on a track of length $R=2 \text{ m}$, elevated at an angle of $30 \deg$.
1. The glider sits at a height of $h= 0.34\text{ m}$ above the bottom of the track. What is its potential energy?
2. What is the distance, $r$, the glider sits from the Range Finder?
3. If the glider were let go, what would be its speed at the end of the track?

## Preparing Our Data Table

This weeks data tables will need quite a few formulae added in, so be sure to give yourself enough time before your lab to complete them.


::::::Activity (table|Making the Table)
1. Create a table with 10+ data rows, similar to [](#Table-datapoints). Add a cell to include the height of the block. Be sure that all heading rows contain the correct units.
2. Using trigonometry and the formulae in the [Appendix](#part5), fill in functions that will automatically calculate the **Height,** **Kinetic** and **Potential** energies as the **Time, Distance and Velocity** and **Block Height** data are filled in.
:::Table (datapoints| Glider Energy Data)
| Data Points | Time | Distance | Velocity | Height | Kinetic Energy | Potential Energy |

# Measuring Energy Transformation
:::Materials (Air Track|Glider|Range Finder --- with calculator|Riser Block)
:::

In [](#Activity-air-track) we will operate the air track in a similar fashion to the way we operated it previously. To set the angle of the track, we will place a block of height $b$ under a leg of the air track. 



We will release the glider on the air track, and the range finder will follow its motion as it rides back and forth on the track. (There is a rubber band at the bottom of the track that causes the glider to bounce back up.) 


- The height $b$ will be $2.0$ cm.

- The mass of the glider with reflector plate is $188.9$ g.

We will release the glider on the air track, and the rangefinder will follow its motion as it rides back and forth on the track (there is a rubber band at the bottom of the track that causes the glider to bounce back up). 

::: Note (|10 C)
The rangefinder records the position and velocity of the glider **starting at the first bounce (with the rubber band at the bottom of the airtrack) and ending at the second bounce**.  Remember that $x=0$ corresponds to the bottom of the airtrack.

## Force, Motion, Linear Acceleration Math Sheet

:::::Hider ( |Gravitational Potential Energy)
Gravitational Potential Energy is given by:

:::Equatio (n)
$$
\rm PE = mgh
$$
:::

where $m$ is the mass, $g$ (= $9.8$ m/s$^2$) is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height the object falls. 
::::::

::::::Hider ( |Kinetic Energy)

Kinetic Energy is given by:
:::Equatio (n)
$$
\rm KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
:::

where $m$ is the mass and $v$ is the velocity.
::::::

::::::Hider ( |Calculating height from distance)
The angle of the track with respect to the horizonal, $\theta$, satisfies

$$
\rm \sin(θ) = \frac{b}{D}
$$

where $b$ is the block height used to place the ramp on an incline and $D$ is the distance between the track's legs in [](#Figure-hov3). 

Similarly, for any position on the ramp, we have that

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{x} 
$$

where $h$ is the height above the bottom of the track and $x$ is the distance along the track from the bottom end. Since both expressions are equivalent to $\sin(\theta)$, we can equate them to obtain the formula:
:::Equatio (n)
$$
\rm h = \frac{bx}{D}
$$
:::

The distance between the legs, $D$, is $100$ cm. You will get the distance from the glider car to the end of the track, $x$, from the rangefinder data .
