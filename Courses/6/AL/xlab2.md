# Forces and Motion


:::Intro (This Week|Air Track|Cart|Riser Block|Force Meter|Scale|Stopwatch)
This week we will look at the quantity that we call energy, and its transformations. In classical physics, there are two categories of energy:
 1. Kinetic Energy &mdash; what you may know as *energy of motion*, or the energy stored in the inertial motion of an object. An object has *kinetic energy* if you have to perform **work** on it to bring it to rest.
 2. Potential Energy &mdash; which is stored energy an object has due to certain kinds of **work** having been exerted on it, *e.g.*, the energy a barbell has after you have lifted it from the floor to above your head.

In addition to understanding energy, this week we will investigate **work** and its relationship with **force** in converting energy from one form to another.

# Acceleration, Mass and Force

:::
If you stand on a skateboard, you don't expect any motion to occur until you do something. Instinctively, you know that you must place a foot on the ground and push off to gain speed &mdash; and hence, accelerate. When you stop pushing, you stop accelerating and move at a somewhat constant speed until friction forces &mdash; air and mechanical &mdash; bring you to rest.

Your acceleration is directly controlled by how hard you push off the ground, which determines the magnitude of the **force** you apply [fn] You may notice that when you are going very fast, it is hard to gain speed because you can't push off the ground! Bicycle users overcome this with *gears*. Why do you think changing gears on a bike allows you to gain speed again?[/fn]. Your acceleration is also determined by your weight and the 55-lb backpack on your back &mdash; your total **mass**.


# The Air Track Experiment

Determining the relationship between force, mass, acceleration should be easy, *right*? In an ideal situation, we simply need to 

In this experiment, we will observe the motion of a glider sliding on an inclined air track under the influence of gravity. We will measure the *mass* of the glider, and the *force* acting on the glider along the track. Finally, by timing the motion of the glider, we will measure its *acceleration* indirectly. This will allow us to look for *correlations* among the quantities $F$, $m$, and $a$ 

After collecting and organizing our data, we will investigate the relationship of these quantities. From analyzing our plots, perhaps we will find that the governing equation is $F = m + a$, or $F = m/a$, or even $F = m^{a}$.

## Setup

[](#Figure-setup) shows a schematic of the air track as it will be set up for this experiment. So that our measurements of the force on the glider and of its motion are minimally affected by friction, the air track has lines of holes drilled along the top faces. Air flowing out of these holes provides a cushion of air on which the glider rides, and virtually eliminates friction between it and the track.

:::::::::
As shown in [](#Figure-setup)[b](), a pump blows air into the track, which exits through the holes, providing a cushion on which the glider hovers along the track, virtually eliminating sliding friction. The track is tilted to an angle $\theta$ by the insertion of a block of height $b$ under one leg of the track. 

## Force v.s. Mass

:::
:::::::::Activity (airtrack-mass| Force v.s. Mass)
**Instructions:**
1. Turn on the air track. Set the pump to Level 3.
2. You should now level the airtrack so as to not impart additional momentum into the cart. The best way to level the
track is to use the cart. Adjust the two leveling screws symmetrically to get the cart to stay in the center of the track.
3. Record the mass of the cart, including the glider-hook, using the balance.
4. Place one of the riser blocks under the single centered leg of the air track.
5. Use the spring-driven force meter to measure the force on your car when it is on the inclined air track: first attach
the glider-hook to the cart. Thread a length of sewing string around the pulley and attach one end to the cart and the
other end to the force meter. When finished recording the force, remove the string from the hook attachment.
6. Without changing the height of the air track ($b$ in [](#Figure-setup)), measure the acceleration of the car. To do this:
    - Measure the distance, L, your cart will travel from the point of release to the bumper at the end of the air
track.
    - Release the cart from rest.
    - Using the stopwatch, measure t, the time it takes to travel the distance.
    - Use the kinematics you learned earlier in the quarter to calculate the acceleration from your measured
values of L and t.
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 for at least 2 more masses. Use the chrome plated attachment masses in pairs. Increase the airflow to 4 if the cart begins to drag on the track.



::::::Exercise
1. Include your table similar to AVOCADO, being sure to follow the best practices.
2. Does changing the mass affect the acceleration? Should it?
3. Using this height, some trigonometry, and vector analysis calculate the theoretical acceleration on the cart from gravity (assume $g = – 9.8 \text{m/s}^2$)
:::Note (|12)
  To get to the acceleration, $\theta$ must first be determined. The angle $\theta$ can be obtained by using $b$ and $D$, where $b$ is the height of
the block and $D$ is the distance between the airtrack's legs. Once $\theta$ has been determined, use what you know about vectors to calculate the acceleration.
:::
4. How does this number compare to what you measured earlier for the acceleration?

# Appendix 
## Force, Motion, Linear Acceleration Math Sheet

:::::Hider (|Gravitational Potential Energy)
Gravitational Potential Energy is given by:

:::Equation
$$
\rm PE = mgh
$$
:::

where $m$ is the mass, $g$ (= $9.8$ m/s$^2$) is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height the object falls. 
::::::

::::::Hider (|Kinetic Energy)

Kinetic Energy is given by:
:::Equation
$$
\rm KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
:::

where $m$ is the mass of the object, and $v$ is its velocity.
::::::

::::::Hider (|Calculating height from distance)
The angle of the track with respect to the horizonal, $\theta$, satisfies

$$
\rm \sin($\theta$) = \frac{b}{D}
$$

where $b$ is the height of the block used to place the track on an incline, and $D$ is the distance between the track's legs in [](#Figure-hov3). 

Similarly, for any position on the track, we have that

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{x} 
$$

where $h$ is the height above the bottom of the track, and $x$ is the distance along the track from the bottom end. Since both expressions are equivalent to $\sin(\theta)$, we can equate them to obtain the formula:
:::Equation
$$
\rm h = \frac{bx}{D}
$$
:::

The distance between the legs, $D$, is $100$ cm. You will get the distance from the glider to the end of the track, $x$, from the range finder data.

## Mass and Force

In [](#Activity-mf) we want to explore how the mass, $m$, of the glider relates to the force, $F$, exerted on it by gravity ***along the track***. As you know, the force due to gravity is vertical, but we are interested **only** in the component along the track, since that is the one that generates the motion.

::::::Activity (mf|Setting up the Track)
 
The experiment is shown in [](#Video-hover), below. Note the following points:
- The glider will be released three times, each time with a different mass. The angle of the air track will be constant across the three runs.
- We release the glider from the top of the track, and record the time for the glider to travel from the start (indicated by a red marker on the video) to when it hits the elastic bumper at the bottom end of the track (indicated by a second red marker on the video). 
- The distance, $D$, between the legs of the track is $100$ cm.
- The height $b$ is $7.6$ cm.
- The distance the glider will travel for each run, $L$, will be $140$ cm.
- The mass, $m$, of the glider with the reflector plate is $188.9$ g. We can attach up to four slugs (in pairs) to the glider  to increase its mass (to $289.9$ or $390.4$ g).

## Acceleration and Force
In [](#Activity-af) we want to explore how the acceleration $a$ of the glider relates to the force $F$ exerted on it. Thus, we will keep the mass of the glider constant, and we will take four runs, each with the track at a different angle. The different incline angles will generate different accelerations along the track. As we did before, we will measure the force on the cart before each run.

::::::Activity (af|Force v.s. Acceleration)

[](#Video-hover2) shows the Acceleration vs. Force experiment. Note the following points:

- For each set of four runs, the heights $b$ will be, in order, $3.7$ cm, $2.0$ cm $1.0$ cm, and $0.5$ cm.

- The force at each height will be $0.108$ N, $0.061$ N, $0.027$ N, and $0.014$ N, respectively.

- The glider mass will be $289.8$ g.
