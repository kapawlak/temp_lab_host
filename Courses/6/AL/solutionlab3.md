# Energy Transformation


:::Intro (This Week...|Air Track|Glider|Range Finder --- with calculator|Riser Block)
This week we will look at the quantity that we call energy and its transformations. In classical physics, there are two categories of energy:
 1. **Kinetic Energy** &mdash; what you may know as *energy of motion*, or the energy stored in the inertial motion of an object. An object has *kinetic energy* if you have to perform **work** on it to bring it to rest.
 2. **Potential Energy** &mdash; which is stored energy an object has due to certain kinds of **work** having been exerted on it, *e.g.*, the energy a barbell has after you have lifted it from the floor to above your head.

In addition to understanding energy, this week we will investigate **work** and its relationship with **force** in converting energy from one form to another.

:::Exercise (slingshot|2 Point)
Where did the kinetic energy come from?
---
The kinetic energy of the stone comes from the work done on it by the rubber band. The rubber band is capable of performing that work since, in the stretched state, it has potential energy.
- *(2 Points)* Correct answer with good effort (One or more full sentences)
- *(1 Point)* Correct answer with mediocre effort (incomplete sentence)
- *(0 Points)* Wrong Answer

:::Exercise (math|3 Point)
The glider is at rest on a track of length $R=2 \text{ m}$, elevated at an angle of $30 \deg$.
1. The glider sits at a height of $h= 0.34\text{ m}$ above the bottom of the track. What is its potential energy?
---
The potential energy (which is relative to the bottom of the track) is simply $mgh=(0.050 \text{kg})(9.81 \text{ms}^{-2})(0.34 \text{m}) = 0.17 J $
I forgot to write that $m = 50 \text{g}$ in the original version of this lab, so accept and answer for m, or even if it was left as a variable. Sorry!
- *(1 Point)* Correct answer with steps shown
- *(0.5 Point)* Almost correct: forgot to convert units.
- *(0 Points)* Wrong Answer or no steps shown
---
2. What is the distance, $r$, the glider sits from the Range Finder?
---
This is an exercise in Trig. Since the track sits at $\theta = 30\deg$, then the distance up the track from the bottom is $h/\sin(\theta) = 0.68 m$. However, the Range Finder sits at the top of the track, so it is at $2\text{m} - 0.68 m = 1.32 \text{m}$
- *(1 Point)* Correct answer with steps shown
- *(0.5 Point)* Almost correct: forgot final step or made a simple mistake.
- *(0 Points)* Totally Wrong Answer or no steps shown

---
3. If the glider were let go, what would be its speed at the end of the track?
---
This has nothing to do with the track, you just need to convert between potential and kinetic energy. Using $\frac{1}{2} m v^2 = mgh$ we find that $v=\sqrt{g h/2} =1.3 \text{m}/\text{s} $
- *(1 Point)* Correct answer with steps shown
- *(0.5 Point)* Almost correct: forgot final step or made a simple mistake. Be easy on sigfigs, I forgot to do them myself :).
- *(0 Points)* Totally Wrong Answer or no steps shown

:::Exercise (table|3 Point)
Provide the complete table of data here, following all the rules of a Good Table

---

- *(-0.5 Points)* for each broken rule of a good table

:::Exercise (plot|2 Point)
1. Make a Good Plot with the kinetic and potential energy data from the experiment.
---
Total value 1 Point
- *(-0.5 Points)* for each broken rule of a good plot
---

2. Is there anything interesting about this plot? Where to the lines cross?
---
The plot should have reflection symmetry about the point where the lines cross. The lines cross where 50% of the energy is in each kinetic and potential.


- *(1 Point)* Good, accurate description, good effort. Identified that the crossing point was 1/2 energy
- *(0.5 Points)* Description has minor issues, did not identify the crossing point
- *(0 Points)* Totally wrong or no effort.

:::Exercise (|3 Point)
1. Does your data support the Law of Conservation of Energy? 

2. What about your data leads you to conclude this? Explain in as much detail as possible.
---
Grad both Q's together
- *(3 Points)* Accurate description and argument applying critical thought
- *(2 Points)* Minor issues with argument
- *(1 Point )* Multiple issues with argument or wrong answer.
- *(0 Points)* Totally wrong or no effort.

:::Exercise (|2 Point)
1. Identify some sources of error and suggest how you could eliminate them.
---
- *(1 Point)* Good Attempt
- *(0 Point)* Poor Attempt
---
2. When the glider hits the rubber band, what are the kinetic and potential energies right when the 
glider changes direction? 
---
The kinetic energy must be zero since the velocity is zero. Since $h=0$, the potential energy must be zero.
- *(0.5 Point)* Good Attempt
- *(0 Point)* Poor Attempt
---
3. Where did the energy go?
---
Since total energy is conserved up to thermal dissipation, all the energy must be in the rubber band
- *(0.5 Point)* Good Attempt
- *(0 Point)* Poor Attempt
