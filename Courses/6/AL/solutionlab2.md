:::Exercise (airtrack|1 Point)
Consider a glider hovering in place on a horizontal airtrack, like that shown in [](#Figure-setup)b. 
1. What is the total net force on the glider?
---
The net force is $0\text{ N}$.
 - 0.5 points correct answer 
 - 0 points wrong answer or no answer


---
2. What is the force generated by the air? ;;;Remember to include the correct sign;;;
---
The force generated by air cancels out gravity, so it is 
$$ 
m \cdot g= 50.0 \text{m} \cdot 9.81 \text{ms}^{-2} = 491\text{ms}^{-2}
$$
- 0.5 points correct answer
- 0.25 points wrong sign or incorrect sigfigs but otherwise correct
- 0 points completely wrong answer or no answer

:::Exercise (acc-equation|2 Points)
Find the equation for the measured acceleration, $a$, on the glider as a function of travel distance $L$ and $t$. You may need to consult the Math Sheets in the Appendix or the previous lab manual. 

---
We need to start from the kinematic equation
$$
x = \frac{1}{2}at^2 +v t +x_0
$$
We set $x_0 = L$, $v_0 =0$ since it starts from rest, and the final distance to $x=0$, ;;;we define it this way, students may say x = L and x0 = 0 and that is ok as long as they are consistent with signs and definitions through the lab;;;
$$
-L = \frac{1}{2}at^2 
$$
and hence
$$
a = -\frac{2 L}{t^2}
$$

- 2 points correct answer, all steps filled out
- 1 point correct answer, some steps missing || steps mostly correct but answer slightly wrong
- 0.5 some attempt made in the correct direction, but many issues.
- 0 totally wrong answer or no work shown

:::::Exercise (acc-cal|2 Points)

Using some or all of the variables defined in [](#Figure-setup)a, plus some trigonometry and vector analysis, write an equation for the theoretical acceleration on the glider from gravity.
:::Note (|12)
To get to the acceleration, $\theta$ must first be determined. The angle $\theta$ can be obtained by using $b$ and $D$, where $b$ is the height of
the block and $D$ is the distance between the airtrack's legs. Once $\theta$ has been determined, use what you know about vectors to calculate the acceleration.
:::

---
We need to project $a$ onto the axis of the air track.

For this exercise, look at the data you collected in #Activity-airtrack-mass and answer the questions.
1. Does changing the mass seem to change the acceleration? Should it? ;;;Defend your answer.;;;
2. Use your equation in [](#Exercise-acc-cal) to find the theoretical values of the acceleration in each trial this experiment. If they are all the same, you may say that.
3. Do you think your experimental values agrees with the theoretical value?
  - If "yes," explain what about your values leads you to believe this.
  - If "no," explain what you think may have caused the disagreement.

::::::Hider (|Calculating height from distance)
The angle of the track with respect to the horizontal, $\theta$, satisfies

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{b}{D}
$$

where $b$ is the height of the block used to place the track on an incline, and $D$ is the distance between the track's legs in [](#Figure-setup). 

Similarly, for any position on the track, we have that

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{x} 
$$

where $h$ is the height above the bottom of the track, and $x$ is the distance along the track from the bottom end. Since both expressions are equivalent to $\sin(\theta)$, we can equate them to obtain the formula:
:::Equation
$$
\rm h = \frac{bx}{D}
$$
:::

The distance between the legs, $D$, is $100$ cm. You will get the distance from the glider to the end of the track, $x$, from the range finder data.
