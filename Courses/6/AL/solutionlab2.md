:::Exercise (airtrack|1 Point)
Consider a glider hovering in place on a horizontal airtrack, like that shown in [](#Figure-setup)b. 
1. What is the total net force on the glider?
---
The net force is $0\text{ N}$.
 - *(0.5 Points)* correct answer 
 - *(0 Points)* wrong answer or no answer


---
2. What is the force generated by the air? ;;;Remember to include the correct sign;;;
---
The force generated by air cancels out gravity, so it is 
$$ 
m \cdot g= 50.0 \text{m} \cdot 9.81 \text{ms}^{-2} = 491\text{ms}^{-2}
$$
- *(0.5 Points)* correct answer
- *(0.25 Points)* wrong sign or incorrect sigfigs but otherwise correct
- *(0 Points)* completely wrong answer or no answer

:::Exercise (acc-equation|2 Points)
Find the equation for the measured acceleration, $a$, on the glider as a function of travel distance $L$ and $t$. You may need to consult the Math Sheets in the Appendix or the previous lab manual. 

---
We need to start from the kinematic equation
$$
x = \frac{1}{2}at^2 +v t +x_0
$$
We set $x_0 = L$, $v_0 =0$ since it starts from rest, and the final distance to $x=0$, ;;;we define it this way, students may say x = L and x0 = 0 and that is ok as long as they are consistent with signs and definitions through the lab;;;
$$
-L = \frac{1}{2}at^2 
$$
and hence
$$
a = -\frac{2 L}{t^2}
$$
Note that they may have a different sign. See comment above. 
- *(2 Points)* correct answer, all steps filled out
- 1 point correct answer, some steps missing || steps mostly correct but answer slightly wrong
- 0.5 some attempt made in the correct direction, but many issues.
- 0 totally wrong answer or no work shown

:::::Exercise (acc-cal|2 Points)

Using some or all of the variables defined in [](#Figure-setup)a, plus some trigonometry and vector analysis, write an equation for the theoretical acceleration on the glider from gravity.
:::Note (|12)
To get to the acceleration, $\theta$ must first be determined. The angle $\theta$ can be obtained by using $b$ and $D$, where $b$ is the height of
the block and $D$ is the distance between the airtrack's legs. Once $\theta$ has been determined, use what you know about vectors to calculate the acceleration.
:::

---
We need to project $a$ onto the axis of the air track. First $\sin(\theta) = b/D $. Then
$$
\begin{aligned}
a &= g \sin(\theta) \\\\
&= \frac{gb}{D}
\end{aligned}
$$
The students may do this in a more roundabout way of calculating $\theta = \arcsin(b/D)$. This is also ok.

- *(2 Points)*: Correct equation all work shown
- *(1 Points)*: Correct Equation, no work OR  wrong Equation but good effort shown

For this exercise, look at the data you collected in #Activity-airtrack-mass and answer the questions.
1. Does changing the mass seem to change the acceleration? Should it? ;;;Defend your answer.;;;
---
Changing the mass should not change the acceleration. They should explain whether or not their data shows this. Their credit depends on their response and not what their data shows

- *(0.5 Points)*: Identifies changing the mass should not change the acceleration. Accurately assesses if their data supports this or not based on if the values seem independent
- *(0.25 Points)*:  
    - Identifies changing the mass should not change the acceleration. Does not accurately assess if their data supports this or not based on if the values seem independent.
    - Incorrectly believes mass should change acceleration. Accurately assesses independence in their data anyway
- *(0 Points)*. Incorrectly assesses both, or no answer

::::::Hider (|Calculating height from distance)
The angle of the track with respect to the horizontal, $\theta$, satisfies

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{b}{D}
$$

where $b$ is the height of the block used to place the track on an incline, and $D$ is the distance between the track's legs in [](#Figure-setup). 

Similarly, for any position on the track, we have that

$$
\rm \sin(\theta) = \frac{h}{x} 
$$

where $h$ is the height above the bottom of the track, and $x$ is the distance along the track from the bottom end. Since both expressions are equivalent to $\sin(\theta)$, we can equate them to obtain the formula:
:::Equation
$$
\rm h = \frac{bx}{D}
$$
:::

The distance between the legs, $D$, is $100$ cm. You will get the distance from the glider to the end of the track, $x$, from the range finder data.
