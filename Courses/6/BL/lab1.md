Our first major topic in Physics 6BL will be simple harmonic motion (SHM), or the oscillating behavior of a body when subjected to a restoring force directly proportional to it's displacement from equilibrium. SHM is a universal behavior, witnessed in everything from springs to pendulums, and even forms the basis of Quantum Field theories. 


In this lab we will learn about SHM by studying the behavior of a pendulum, and characterizing how carrying certain physical variables of a pendulum change its behavior.

# Introduction




:::Figure (sho|xs|R)
![](imgs/Lab1/SHO.gif 'Mass on a spring ')
:::

Simple harmonic motion &mdash; the simple oscillatory behavior of a mass bouncing on a spring &mdash; is found everywhere in nature, both in the classical and quantum world! Because of this, the theory of simple harmonic motion will be a recurring theme throughout your physics career: many different systems can be modeled or approximated as harmonic oscillators. 

One of the most accessible systems that can be approximated by simple harmonic motion is the pendulum. A **pendulum** is a weight hung from a fixed point so that it can swing freely backward and forward under gravity. As you know intuitively, when you hang a mass from a pivot point, and let it go from a position higher than its minimum, it will continue to swing back and forth until friction or external forces bring it to rest at its equilibrium point. When a pendulum weight is let go from a small height above its minimum ;;; otherwise a **small angle**;;;, its motion is very well approximated by a harmonic oscillator 



The objective of this lab is to determine the physical quantities that influence the period of a pendulum. The period is how long it takes for the pendulum to make one complete cycle of motion. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement. We will test how each of these parameters influences the period of the pendulum by varying one of them while keeping the other two constant.

## Preparing for the Pendulum Experiments

In the following [Activity](#Activity-tables), we will be preparing our data tables and calculations so that we can quickly take down data and see the final results of calculations. We will need four tables in this lab, one for each parameter (mass $m$, initial angle $\theta_0$, length $L$) we will vary during the experiment, and one table for additional length data. We are interested in how varying each of these parameters affects the period of oscillation, $T$. 

If you haven't done so, please preview the lab procedure in [Part II](#part2) to familiarize yourself the the general procedure. After reviewing this, continue on to [](#Activity-tables) to prepare the data tables and basic calculations.


::::::Activity (tables|Preparing the Tables)
In this lab, we will need four data tables: three are for exploring the dependence of period on three parameters, and one for a more detailed exploration of $T$ v.s. $L$. 
1. A very basic template of these tables is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1prSaLpiSssbD8Dj2goacOyrGukwA9QpgQPbgtWdFdYM/edit?usp=sharing). Please **copy** these into a personal spreadsheet.
2. These tables are not [Good Tables](?linkfile=FAQ#QHowdoIreceivefullcreditonatableinmylabreport). Add missing elements and formatting to ensure that they are good, descriptive tables. You will need to come up with a descriptive title for each table.
3. For each column titled **1 Period**, insert a spreadsheet function that will calculate the average period of the pendulum using the **10 Period** value ;;;You may wish to enter "dummy" data to ensure that your spreadsheet function is working;;;
4. In the final table, you will need to add in a spreadsheet function to calculate the LOG10 of the period and length data as appropriate.

For your Prelab: Link a copy of each of Tables 1-3 in the exercises you will use them in ([](Exercise-table1),[](Exercise-table2), [](Exercise-table3) respectively). You can find how to do this in the [FAQ](?linkfile=FAQ). They will automatically update if you are linking between a Google sheet and a Google doc.

:::Note (|10 C)
When linked sheets are updated, any edits to the data in the original file will appear in the Google Docs file. If you make edits to the linked chart, table, or slide in your Google Docs, the **changes won't be copied to the original file** and will be lost.

## Preparing the Theory

This lab is all about exploring the dependence of the period on different parameters of a pendulum. As an example, we can explore how a pendulum's period might depend on the length of the string. Let's assume that the period $T$ depends on the length $L$ in a non-linear way, namely a power law:

::: Equation generalizedPeriod
$$T=a L^b$$
:::

where $a$ and $b$ are unknown values that do not matter to us right now &mdash; they could depend on other parameters, such as the mass, angle, color or latitude of the pendulum.


From your data analysis lab, you recall learning about "linearizing" data, that is, making nonlinear data fit a straight line. The method you used was to take the logarithm of both the independent variable ($x$) and  the dependent variable ($y$) values, to plot them, and from that plot find the power of $x$ (and/or $y$) and the proportionality constant in the original equation. 

We will repeat this analysis in this lab after collecting some data. One of our goals will be to determine the **numerical values** of $a$ and $b$ in [](#Equation-generalizedPeriod). To prepare for this, we will first want to linearize this equation. As a reminder, the below drop-down summarizes the mathematical properties of logs

:::::: Hider (logs|A reminder about properties of logarithms:)

:::Equation (logRules)
$$\log(XY) = \log(X) + \log(Y)$$

$$\log(\frac{X}{Y}) = \log(X) - \log(Y)$$

$$\log(X^Y) = Y \log(X)$$ 

$$10^{log (f)} = f$ $

# The Pendulum Experiments
## Mass

We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the mass $m$ of the bob attached to its end. To do so, we will vary the mass, $m$, while keeping the length, $L$, and initial angle, $\theta_0$, constant.

::::::Activity (mass| Period as a function of Mass)

We have **three** (3) bobs of different masses that we can place at the end of our pendulum. 

1. Set the length of the string to about $1 \text{ m}$ by sliding the plastic clip gently up or down the rod, as demonstrated by your TA
2. One partner should align the mass to an initial displacement of $5^\circ-20^\circ$ while keeping the string taut. 
:::Note (|10 C)
This angle should be measured from the vertical, e.g. from  the $90^\circ$ mark.
::: 
3. When one partner starts the timer, the other should simultaneously let go of the mass.
:::Note (|10 C)
TIt is important that the pendulum swing in the plane parallel to the protractor.
To achieve this, you must release the mass in this plane, with no other components of motion. The easiest method is to
have one lab partner release the bob in the correct direction, while the second lab partner reads the initial
angular displacement. 
::: 
4. Stop the timer after 10 full (out and back) swings and record your data
5. Repeat this procedure for three different masses in total, keeping length and angular displacement fixed ;;;use the same angle for each trial!;;;. Record your results for each mass trial. Your spreadsheet function should divide these times by 10 to get the average period for each trial.


::::::

:::Exercise (table1|2 Point)
1. Include your completed [Good Table](?linkfile=FAQ#QHowdoIreceivefullcreditonatableinmylabreport) here.
2. Does the period appear to depend on mass? Justify your answer in 2-3 sentences.
:::


## Initial Angle

Conventional analysis of the pendulum is done for small angles, where the restoring force experienced by the mass is approximately linear with the displacement angle. A linear restoring force is one of the criteria for simple harmonic motion. When the displacement angles become large, the restoring force is no longer linear. The motion is still periodic, but it is not sinusoidal, and the mathematical analysis becomes far more involved. In this lab we will focus only on small displacement angles, and thus simple harmonic motion.


We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the initial angle $\theta_0$ of the bob attached to its end. To do so, we will vary the initial angle, $\theta_0$, while keeping the length, $L$, and mass, $m$, constant.

::::::Activity (angle| Period as a function of Initial Angle)

You will be working with only a single mass ;;; any is fine ;;; for this part of the experiment, and only one pendulum length. You will repeat the experiment for the pendulum starting at the different initial angles of $5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$, and $15^{\circ}$.  You will collect your data from this video.

1. Use the same method as in [](#Activity-mass), but instead of changing the mass, choose three different initial angles ($5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$, and $15^{\circ}$) to test.
2. Record your angles and 10-Period times into your spreadsheet. The average 1-Period times should be automatically calculated.

:::

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
Why can you use only one mass instead of all five different masses in order to determine if period depends on initial angle? Respond in 1-2 sentences.
:::

## Length

We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the length of the pendulum $L$. To do so, we will vary the length $L$, while keeping the initial angle, $\theta_0$, and mass, $m$, constant.

::::::Activity (mass| Period as a function of Length)

In the following procedure, you will set-up three pendulum experiments with the same mass (mass #2) and initial angle of $10^{\circ}$. The only parameter that varies among runs is the length, $L$. The lengths you should use should be approcimately $80 \text{cm}, 60 \text{cm}, 40 \text{cm}$

1. Use the same method as in [](#Activity-mass), but instead of changing the mass, choose three different lengths (Approximately $80 \text{cm}, 60 \text{cm}, 40 \text{cm}$ &mdash; record your *actual* value!) to test.
2. Record your lengths and 10-Period times into your spreadsheet. The average 1-Period times should be automatically calculated.

# Determining Mathematical Dependence


From your previous investigations on which parameters affect the period of the pendulum you should have concluded that the length $L$ affects the period of the pendulum. In this part, we will attempt to find the mathematical relationship between the period $T$ and the length $L$.


::::::Activity (additional|Additional $L$ v.s. $T$ Data)

We will now set-up a more rigorous experiment where you vary the length in approximately $10 cm$ increments.

1. Start at about $L=20\text{ cm}$, go to about $160 \text{cm}$.
:::Note (|10C)
If you use the same mass as in step 4) above you may include those measurements to save time.
:::

2. Choose the same initial displacement of $10^\circ$ for all trials.
3. Repeat the measurment steps to obtain the 10-period time for all angles.
4. Make a plot of period vs. length (include all elements of a good plot).

## Comparing Experiment to Theory
The relationship between the period and length can be derived theoretically to be:

:::Equation (period|Theoretical Period of a Small-Angle Pendulum)
$$
T = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
$$
:::

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($g=9.8\rm\ m/s^2$). We want to compare our nonlinear equation, [](#Equation-generalizedPeriod), (which we guessed) to the theoretical model.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)

2. What numerical values would you expect for $a$ and $b$ from the theoretical model?

3. Calculate the percent discrepancy between the measured and theoretical values for $a$ and $b$.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
1. Express the acceleration due to gravity $g$ in terms of $a$ and $b$.

2. What numerical value do you obtain for $g$?

3. What is the percent discrepancy between the accepted value of $g$ and your calculated value?
