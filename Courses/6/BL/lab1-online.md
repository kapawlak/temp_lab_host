Our first major topic in Physics 6BL will be simple harmonic motion (SHM), or the oscillating behavior of a body when subjected to a restoring force directly proportional to it's displacement from equilibrium. SHM is a universal behavior, witnessed in everything from springs to pendulums, and even forms the basis of Quantum Field theories. 


In this lab we will learn about SHM by studying the behavior of a pendulum, and characterizing how carrying certain physical variables of a pendulum change its behavior.

:::

Simple harmonic motion &mdash; the simple oscillatory behavior of a mass bouncing on a spring &mdash; is found everywhere in nature, both in the classical and quantum world! Because of this, the theory of simple harmonic motion will be a recurring theme throughout your physics career: many different systems can be modeled or approximated as harmonic oscillators. 

One of the most accessible systems that can be approximated by simple harmonic motion is the pendulum. A **pendulum** is a weight hung from a fixed point so that it can swing freely backward and forward under gravity. As you know intuitively, when you hang a mass from a pivot point, and let it go from a position higher than its minimum, it will continue to swing back and forth until friction or external forces bring it to rest at its equilibrium point. When a pendulum weight is let go from a small height above its minimum ;;; otherwise a **small angle**;;;, its motion is very well approximated by a harmonic oscillator 



The objective of this lab is to determine the physical quantities that influence the period of a pendulum. The period is how long it takes for the pendulum to make one complete cycle of motion. The relevant features are the mass of the bob, the length of the pendulum, and the initial angular displacement. We will test how each of these parameters influences the period of the pendulum by varying one of them while keeping the other two constant.

## Preparing for the Pendulum Experiments

In the following [Activity](#Activity-tables), we will be preparing our data tables and calculations so that we can quickly take down data and see the final results of calculations. We will need three tables in this exercise, one for each parameter (mass $m$, initial angle $\theta_0$, length $L$) we will vary during the experiment. We are interested in how varying each of these parameters affects the period of oscillation, $T$. 

If you haven't done so, please preview the lab procedure in [Part II](#part2) to familiarize yourself the the general procedure. After reviewing this, continue on to [](#Activity-tables) to prepare the data tables and basic calculations.


::::::Activity (tables|Preparing the Tables (10 min))
In this lab, we will need three data tables. 
1. A very basic template of these three tables is provided [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DDIQSRuBLbqCgpXy2pXZxzmEegwtEWjupJs3e6fj_GU/edit?usp=sharing). Please **copy** these into a personal spreadsheet.
2. These tables are not [Good Tables](?linkfile=FAQ#QHowdoIreceivefullcreditonatableinmylabreport). Add missing elements and formatting to ensure that they are good, descriptive tables. You will need to come up with a descriptive title for each table.
3. For each column titled **1 Period**, insert a spreadsheet function that will calculate the average period of the pendulum using the **10 Period** value ;;;You may wish to enter "dummy" data to ensure that your spreadsheet function is working;;;

Link a copy of each of these tables to the exercises you will use them in ([](Exercise-table1),[](Exercise-table2), [](Exercise-table3) respectively). They will automatically update if you are linking between a Google sheet and a Google doc.

:::Note (|10 C)
When linked sheets are updated, any edits to the data in the original file will appear in the Google Docs file. If you make edits to the linked chart, table, or slide in your Google Docs, the **changes won't be copied to the original file** and will be lost.

# The Pendulum Experiments
## Mass

We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the mass $m$ of the bob attached to its end. To do so, we will vary the mass, $m$, while keeping the length, $L$, and initial angle, $\theta_0$, constant.

::::::Activity (mass| Period as a function of Mass (15 min))

We have **five** (5) bobs of different masses that we can place at the end of our pendulum. Below is a video showing the mass of each bob being measured. Watch this video to determine the mass of each of the five bobs. Throughout this lab, we will use the same numbering scheme for each bob that we use in this video, so when we say, for example, "Mass 4" in a later video, we are talking about the same mass presented here.

:::

1. Fill your Table 1 with the measured mass values. Make the video pause, and use the triple beam balance to make your best measurement of the mass.

In the next video you will be shown five different pendulums. The only thing that is different among the five pendulums is the mass that is used. The initial angle for each setup is $20^{\circ}$, and the length is $80\rm\ cm$.

:::

2. For each mass, use the stopwatch in the video, a stopwatch app, or the video time stamp, to record the time it takes for the pendulum to undergo **ten** (10) complete periods. A complete period is the time it takes for the pendulum to swing back and forth once. 
:::Note (|10 C)
Start the stopwatch when the pendulum is at the beginning of a period, then, when it has reached the end of the tenth period from the start, stop the stopwatch.
:::
3. Input this time into your table. Your spreadsheet function should divide it by ten to obtain an average time for one period in the designated column.

2. Does the period appear to depend on mass? Justify your answer in 2-3 sentences.
:::


## Initial Angle

Conventional analysis of the pendulum is done for small angles, where the restoring force experienced by the mass is approximately linear with the displacement angle. A linear restoring force is one of the criteria for simple harmonic motion. When the displacement angles become large, the restoring force is no longer linear. The motion is still periodic, but it is not sinusoidal, and the mathematical analysis becomes far more involved. In this lab we will focus only on small displacement angles, and thus simple harmonic motion.


We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the initial angle $\theta_0$ of the bob attached to its end. To do so, we will vary the initial angle, $\theta_0$, while keeping the length, $L$, and mass, $m$, constant.

::::::Activity (angle| Period as a function of Initial Angle (10 min))

You will be working with only a single mass for this part of the experiment, and only one pendulum length. Below is a video of a pendulum with mass #2. The video shows the pendulum starting at the different initial angles of $5^{\circ}$, $10^{\circ}$, and $15^{\circ}$.  You will collect your data from this video.

1. Record the average period for each initial angle. Use the same method as in [](#Activity-mass) to measure the period.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
Why can you use only one mass instead of all five different masses in order to determine if period depends on initial angle? Respond in 1-2 sentences.
:::

## Length

We will investigate if the period $T$ of the pendulum depends on the length of the pendulum $L$. To do so, we will vary the length $L$, while keeping the initial angle, $\theta_0$, and mass, $m$, constant.

::::::Activity (mass| Period as a function of Length (15 min))

In the following video you will see three pendulums all having the same mass (mass #2) and initial angle of $10^{\circ}$. The only thing that varies among runs is the length. After the first run, there will be a brief close-up of the mass with a meterstick in the background. You can use this to make your own length measurement. For the second run, the length will be  $40 \rm cm$, and for the third it will be  $24 \rm cm$.

1. Use the same method as in [](#Activity-mass) and [](#Activity-angle) to measure the average period for each pendulum length.

# Determining Mathematical Dependence


From your previous investigations on which parameters affect the period of the pendulum you should have concluded that the length $L$ affects the period of the pendulum. In this part, we will attempt to find the mathematical relationship between the period $T$ and the length $L$.


::::::Activity (additional|Additional $L$ v.s. $T$ Data (15 min))

Below is a (very-much-sped-up) video of several pendulums with mass #2. The initial angles are all $10^{\circ}$. We vary the length from 96 $\rm cm$ to $\rm 24$ cm. To keep the lab from being too long, we will provide you with the data that we collected.

1. Watch the video.

## Analyzing the Data

<!-- One method you used was changing the independent variable of your data, which works great when you have an idea about what the equation *should* look like. The other method you used was to take the logarithm of both *x* and *y* values, to plot them, and from that plot find the power of *x* (and/or *y*) and the proportionality constant in the original equation. -->
Let's assume that the period $T$ depends on the length $L$ in a non-linear way, namely a power law:
