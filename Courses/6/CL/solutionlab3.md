::::::Intro (In this Lab)
Now that we are familiar with the principles of *ray optics*, we will move on to talk about **wave optics**. As the name suggests, wave optics considers the wave-like properties of light, and the phenomena that emerge from this description &mdash; in particular, **diffraction** and **interference**. These phenomena occur on very small length scales compared to the domain of ray optics.

:::Equation (max| Interference Maximums)
$$
y_m = m \lambda \frac{D}{d}
$$
:::


**Interference**

Let's start by focusing only on interference. 

1. Click the diffraction checkbox to uncheck the box and turn off diffraction effects.  This will ignore any effects the width of the slits has on the intensity, so that slider is not active anymore.

An important thing to notice is that that when there is no diffraction, all maxima are **equally bright and equally spaced**.  

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
1. Use [](#Equation-max) to predict what will happen to the locations of the maxima on the screen ($y_m$) when you adjust the slit separation $d$  (*i.e.*, what happens when we increase and decrease the slit separation).
---

As slit separation increases, the locations of the maxima decrease as the inverse. As it decreases, the seperation increases.
- *(0.5 Points)* for correct answer
- *(0 Points)* wrong answer

---
2. Use [](#Equation-max)  to predict what will happen to the locations of the maxima on the screen ($y_m$) when you adjust the wavelength ($\lambda$).
---
As the wavelength increases, the locations of the maxima increase linearly. As it decreases, the seperation decreases linearly.
- *(0.5 Points)* for correct answer
- *(0 Points)* wrong answer
:::

2. Adjust the slit separation while leaving everything else the same. Pay attention to what happens on the screen and in the intensity plot.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
How does adjusting the slit separation affect the pattern on the screen (or the intensity plot)? Things to consider might include the positions of the maxima, the brightness of the maxima, the separation between the maxima, or anything else you find notable.

---
- *(1 Points)* Good correct descriptions. Well-written 1-2 sentences
- *(0.5 Points)* OK descriptions, some attempt made even if wrong
- *(0 Points)* Very wrong/no attempt
:::

3.  Make sure the slit separation is somewhere in the near the middle of the range. Adjust the wavelength while keeping the other parameters constant.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
How does adjusting the wavelength affect the pattern on the screen or the intensity plot (besides color; remember your prediction based on [](#Eq-max)? Things to consider might include the positions of the maxima, the brightness of the maxima, the separation between the maxima, or anything else you find notable.

---
- *(1 Points)* Good correct descriptions. Well-written 1-2 sentences
- *(0.5 Points)* OK descriptions, some attempt made even if wrong
- *(0 Points)* Very wrong/no attempt
:::
 
**Diffraction**

Now we will consider only diffraction effects. As mentioned in the introduction, diffraction can occur with only one slit, while interference takes at least two. 

1. Start by sliding the slit separation to $0\ \mu\rm{m}$. This will turn the two slits into one.
2. Now turn on diffraction by checking the box. 

Notice that now we have one large peak in the center and many much smaller peaks to the sides. This is the **diffraction envelope** shown in Figure 3. 

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
1. How does adjusting the slit width change the diffraction envelope?
---
- *(0.5 Points)* Good correct description
- *(0 Points)*  wrong/no attempt
---
2. How does adjusting the wavelength change the diffraction envelope?
---
- *(0.5 Points)* Good correct description
- *(0 Points)*  wrong/no attempt

:::

**Interference and Diffraction**

Now we will look at interference and diffraction happening at the same time. This is much more like what you would see in real life.

1. Adjust the separation slider until there are two slits again, somewhere around $200\ \mu\rm{m}$. 
2. Adjust the width to about $25\ \mu\rm{m}$.
3. Make sure the diffraction checkbox is still on.

Notice the outline of the diffraction envelope and the interference pattern inside of it. Also notice that where the diffraction envelope goes to zero, there is not a maximum, even if the interference equation says there should be one.

3. To help see this, try turning diffraction on and off, and pay close attention to where the diffraction envelope goes to zero.

:::Note (|9 C)
This is important, because if we are labeling the interference maxima (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.), we want to make sure that we still label the interference maxima that are at the zero points of the diffraction envelope.
:::

4. Make sure that diffraction is checked in order to see the diffraction effects.

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
Based on the interference only and diffraction only part of the exercise, predict what will happen if you adjust the following parameters independently:

1. The slit width.

2. The slit separation.

3. The wavelength (besides a change in color).

---
Use your judgment
:::





:::Exercise (|1 Point)
1. If you decrease the slit width, why do more peaks appear in the central diffraction envelope?

2. If you increase the slit separation, why do more peaks appear in the central diffraction envelope?

3. If you increase or decrease the wavelength, why does the number of peaks within the central diffraction envelope remain the same?
---
Use your judgment
:::







:::Exercise (equation|1 Point)
Rearrange [](#Equation-max) so that you can calculate the wavelength of the laser, $\lambda$, from the measured maxima and locations, the distance to the screen, and the slit spacing.

---
Students should get $\lambda= m \frac{D}{d y_m}$
- *(1 Point)* Correct
- *(0  Points)* Wrong
:::


:::Exercise (cd|1 Point)
Search for "Compact Disc Track Spacing". 
1. What is the spacing *between* the tracks for a standard CD?
---
- *(0.5 Points)* 1.5 or 1.6 $\mu \text{m}$ depending on source
---
2. Give your source for this information.
---
- *(0.5 Points)* Valid source provided

:::Exercise (|1 Point)
1. What do you observe on the screen? Make a **sketch** of it (either on a digital program or draw it by hand and attach a photo of the drawing -- do not attach a photo of the pattern itself) and put it in your notebook.
---
- *(0.25 Point)* Sketch provided and looks good
- *(0  Points)* Otherwise
---
2. Are these the kind of shadows you would expect to see if you cut two notches in a piece of paper and shined a light through it? 
---
- *(0.25 Point)* Correct description
- *(0  Points)* Otherwise
---
3. How does the pattern on the screen change when you decrease the slit separation?
---
- *(0.5 Point)* Correct description, well described
- *(0.25 Point)* Poorly  described/some issue
- *(0  Points)* totally wrong/no effort

:::




:::Exercise (|1 Point)
Reflect on the following:
1. In the above note, we ask you to place the laser + slit disk and screen on the opposite sides of the track. Why is this a good idea?
---
This increases the image of the difraction pattern, allowing them to make a more precise measurment.
- *(0.5 Point)* Correct reason or close, well described, especially using the word "precision"
- *(0.25 Point)* good attempt but minor/major issues
- *(0  Points)* totally wrong/no effort
---
2. Why might you want to measure the distance from $-m$ to $m$ rather than directly measure each maxima from center maxima?
---
It reduces error by effectively averaging two measurements. This is similar in spirit to measuring 10 cycles of a pendulum instead of one to reduce the relative size of the reaction time error.

- *(0.5 Point)* Correct reason or close, well described
- *(0.25 Point)* good attempt but major issues
- *(0  Points)* totally wrong/no effort
