:::


[](#Figure-refrac) above shows beams of light being emitted from the blue semicircle at the bottom left. There are some important features to observe:
- The rays travel through a medium having an index of refraction of $n_1$, toward the interface of that medium with a second medium having an index of refraction of $n_2$. 
- The beams in the lower region are the *incident* beams. 
- The beams in the upper region are the *refracted* beams. 
- When light reaches the interface, some of it is reflected back into the first medium, but most of it is refracted into the second medium. 
- Note that two of the exiting beams, B and C, are bent (*refracted*) away from the normal [fn]Ray D is also bent away from the normal, but represents a special case, which we will see later in this lab.[/fn]. 
- When a beam is perpendicular to the interface boundary, as is beam A, it is said to be *normal* to the interface. Normal rays are undeflected. 
  
 This figure could represent light coming from water and going into air. 



:::Exercise (|1 Point)
Look at [](#Figure-refrac) to answer the following:

1. Light ray A is normal to the interface.  What is the angle of incidence $\theta_1$ for this ray? According to Snell's law, what is the angle of refraction $\theta_2$? 
---

The angle should clearly be $0$. This is just a check to make sure this got through to them
- *(0.5 Points)* Correct answer with reference to snell's law
- *(0.25 Points)* Correct answer with no reference to snell's law
- *(0 Points)* Wrong answer

---

2. Is the angle of the refracted light beam B larger or smaller than the angle of incidence? What about light beam C? According to Snell's Law, what does the relative magnitude of the angles (*i.e.*, $\theta_2/\theta_1$) tell us about the relative magnitude of the indexes $n_1$ and $n_2$?
---
Ideally, they should find that beach ball was most affected, but make your best judgement. 
- *(0.5 Points)* Correct answer with reference to snell's law and assesment about indexes
- *(0.25 Points)* Correct answer with no reference to snell's law or poor assesment
- *(0 Points)* Wrong answer or missing assessment

:::Exercise (snell-rearranged|2 Points)
In our experiment, we will want to calculate the index of refraction of a prism by measuring the angle of incidence and angle of refraction at the interface between the prism and air. Without loss of generality, assume that we are making these measurements such that the light is *leaving* the prism and *entering the air* at this interface.
1. Based on the interface we are studying, do you think $\theta_1$ or $\theta_2$ should be larger? Defend your answer
---
We are studying acrylic->air interface, so refracted angle should be larger. This should be apparent since $\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\sin(\theta_1)}{\sin(\theta_2)}> 1$ and sine is monotonic in $(0, \pi/2)$ (Students of course won't write this, but any attempt similar in spirit should be rewarded).

- *(0 Points)* Missing or very poor effort

2. Starting from [](#Equation-snell), derive an expression that gives the value of $n_1$ in terms of $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$ and $n_2$  
---
- *(0.5 Points)* Correct result, shows steps
- *(0.25 Points)* minor issues with results or steps
- *(0 Points)* Missing or very poor attempt
---
3. Given that one of the interfaces is *air*, can you make a substitution in your answer to part (b) that simplifies your equation? If so, write the simpler equation. If not, explain why.
---
We want them to set $n_2 = 1$.

:::Exercise (find|1 Point)
Change the top material to air and the bottom material to Mystery B in [](#Simulation-mystery_critical).
1. Using any angle of incidence you'd like, calculate index of refraction, $n$ for the material "Mystery B?" Show your work.
---
They should get around $1.4-1.5$ depending on how carefully they measured
- *(0.5 Points)* Correct result, shows steps
- *(0.25 Points)* minor issues with results or steps
- *(0 Points)* Missing or very poor attempt

2. Now swap the  materials so that the top is "Mystery B" and the bottom is air. What is the critical angle? ;;;The simulation is hard to get just right â€” give your best guess at the lower bound;;;
3. Calculate $n$ using the critical angle you found.
4. Do you think that these values agree?
---
Critical angle should be about $43 \deg \pm 5\deg$. This means that they should calculate a similar value, $n\approx 1.4-1.5$, and hence they should agree up to the ability to measure by eye.Be lenient.
